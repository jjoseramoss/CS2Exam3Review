// NOTES:

// Advantages of C++ Recursion
// It makes our code shorter and cleaner.
// Recursion is required in problems concerning data structures and advanced algorithms, such as Graph and Tree Traversal.
// Disadvantages of C++ Recursion
// It takes a lot of stack space compared to an iterative program.
// It uses more processor time.
// It can be more difficult to debug compared to an equivalent iterative program.
