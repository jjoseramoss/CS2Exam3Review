// 4. Search (and complexity) – review the following search algorithms
// a. Sequential Search
// b. Binary Search
// *What are the restrictions (if any) for using these?
// *How many steps does it take in the worst case to give an answer if I 
// provide you with a list of 1,000 numbers? 2,000?
// *Is one always better than the other? We mentioned in class that one 
// of these can be much much faster than the other – does this mean it is 
// the superior choice in all situations? Be prepared to explain your 
// reasoning.
