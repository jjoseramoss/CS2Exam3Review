// 5. Trees - What is the difference between a linked list and a tree-based 
// data structure? How are they similar?
// 6. Trees – Review the tree based data structures that we introduced in 
// class (there were only two so far)
// 7. Binary Search Tree (code) – See the list of values below. Be 
// prepared to complete any of the following with both plain language 
// explanations and code:
// {14 8 -10 -20 3 -5 -12 6 -7 -16}
// *Draw the resulting Binary Search Tree, and identify things such as the 
// number of leaf nodes, the level of any given node (for example, the level of -
// 5) and the height and size of the tree.
// * Given a search value (for example, zero) be prepared to explain in specific 
// steps how to determine whether or not the value is present in the tree 
// (remember that we start with a root node, which can only see its children!)
// *If the value is not present, explain the steps needed to insert the node
// *You can assume that any code task you are given for your binary search 
// tree will contain Nodes with a format like the one shown below:
