// Sorting â€“ Review the following sorting algorithms we covered in class 
// and lab:
// a. bubble sort
// b. selection sort
// *Each one of these has multiple iterations of a specific task (we can 
// call this a subtask) in order to sort a list of values. Make sure you are 
// able to explain what the subtask accomplishes given a list of values. 
// For example, what does 1 iteration of selection sort achieve given a list
// of values?
